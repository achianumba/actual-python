    !!! note
        **Skip to step 3 below** if the above operation prints an error message 
        about being unable to recognize `'python'`.
        However, if running the above command prints something like `Python 3.x.x`.
        It means Python is already installed on your computer.
        Just skip to the [install a code editor](/install-code-editor) page.

3. Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads) in your web browser.
4. Click the `Download Python 3.x.x` button to download Python to your computer.

    `Install Python 3.x.x` window displayed and click `Install now`.
