# Setup Your Local Python Development Environment

Setting up your **local Python development environment** is the first step in 
becoming a Python developer. This guide helps you install Python and a code editor that 
you'll use to write Python code on your Computer.

## Why Use a Local Environment Instead of Cloud Tools?

> Real developers build locally. Here’s why:

- The industry uses local development, not sandboxed cloud environments.
- You own your environment. No internet required, no vendor lock-in.
- Total access to your file system, hardware, and editor configuration.
- You’ll learn how Python really works: environments, dependencies, file structure — not just clicking “Run.”

## 🔧 What You'll Need

- A Python interpreter
- A code editor
