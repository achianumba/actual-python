# Setup Your Local Python Development Environment

Setting up your **local Python development environment** is the first step in 
becoming a Python developer. This guide helps you install Python and a code editor that 
you'll use to write Python code on your Computer.

## Why Use a Local Environment Instead of Cloud Tools?

> Real developers build locally. Here‚Äôs why:

- The industry uses local development, not sandboxed cloud environments.
- You own your environment. No internet required, no vendor lock-in.
- Total access to your file system, hardware, and editor configuration.
- You‚Äôll learn how Python really works: environments, dependencies, file structure ‚Äî not just clicking ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù

        **Skip to step 4 below** if the above operation prints an error message 
        about being unable to recognize `'python'`.
        However, if running the above command prints something like `Python 3.x.x`.
        It means Python is already installed on your computer.
        Just skip to the `Install VSCode` section below.
