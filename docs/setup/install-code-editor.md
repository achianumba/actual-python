# Install a Code Editor

A code editor, like the name suggests, is used to edit code. Think of it like a *suped* up Microsoft Word or Notepad that is used to write text, except code editors provide software development-specific tools.

Although there are Python-specific code editors out in the wild, it's sufficient to begin with a general purpose code editor such as Visual Studio Code because it is free and has everything you need to get started.
